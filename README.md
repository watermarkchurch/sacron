# SACRON

Pronounced */ˈseɪ-krɒn/*

Sacron is a linux service that helps your servers to honor God by keeping the Sabbath.

> "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Exodus 20:8"

Sacron works by shutting down your `cron` service every Saturday at sundown,
and starting it back up again on Sunday at sundown.

> “‘Observe the Sabbath day, to keep it holy, as the Lord your God commanded you.
> Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath
> to the Lord your God. On it you shall not do any work, you or your son or your
> daughter or your male servant or your female servant, or your ox or your donkey
> or any of your livestock, or the sojourner who is within your gates, that your
> male servant and your female servant may rest as well as you. You shall remember
> that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the Lord your God brought you
> out from there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm. Therefore the Lord
> your God commanded you to keep the Sabbath day.
> Deutoronomy 5:12-15
